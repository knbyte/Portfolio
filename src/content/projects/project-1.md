During my time as a job coach I saw how a lot of people struggled with resume building. It was a part of my job to help clients get basic resumes together, but there was never sufficient time in the 15 minute appointment slots.

In personal time I developed a website containing resume templates I designed as well as providing guides showing other resources for job searching, housing and various other support information. The origninal version of this was quickly made using a website builder ([TailorBrands](https://studio.tailorbrands.com/)), since then I have made my own website, hosted with [Vultr](https://www.vultr.com/). In the future I hope to add a lot more detail, resources and styling!
