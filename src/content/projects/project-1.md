During my time as a job coach I saw how a lot of people struggled with resume building. It was a part of my job to help clients get basic resumes together, but there was never sufficient time in the 15 minute appointment slots.

In personal time I developed a website containing resume templates I designed as well as providing guides showing other resources
for job searching, housing and various other support information.

The website is not currently up, but you can follow the github link is a downloadable version of what it looked like along with some of the resources I created.
