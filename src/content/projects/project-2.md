During the 42 Pisine (Programming bootcamp to become a student at the school), [one of the other students](https://github.com/jogdog77) and I created a resourse to help everyone customise their terminals and vim pages to make everything more readable and user friendly. You can download the PDF <a href="public\Customising Vim & iTerm.pdf">here</a>.
