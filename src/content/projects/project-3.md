B.E.R.T is a web-browsing companion that encourages you to take moments out of your day for your well-beingâ€”whether it is a 20-second stretch or a 5-minute meditation.

Bert has (for the moment) three main modes - Stretch, Breathe and Focus - as well as an additional section holding links to mental health resources.

Wxt was used to create most of the boilerplate and enable us to use other tools and frameworks without worrying about how to integrate it with the limits browsers place on extensions Svelte was used to simplify and accelerate the creation of the user interface since we had a lot of separate components that would quickly turn into an incomprehensible mess without a framework.
